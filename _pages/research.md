Previously I trained under <a href="https://www.neuroengineer.org/">Dr. Parag Patil</a> at the University of Michigan, where I worked on optimizing 
deep-brain stimulation (DBS) treatment by developing patient-specific maps of the brain. I also did a 6-month
internship at Boston Scientific Neuromodulation, developing algorithms for closed-loop DBS.

Currently, I work in <a href="https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu/">Prof. Cindy Chestek's</a> group at Michigan, 
where I am developing algorithms for decoding movement from brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
I work on the following:
- neural networks for improved real-time movement decoding from intracortical BCIs
- methods for improving BCI power consumption without sacrificing performance
- algorithms for decoding EMG for prosthetic control
