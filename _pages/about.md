I'm a postdoc researcher at the University of Michigan working on algorithms for brain-computer interfaces. 
My research in the [Willsey lab](https://www.willseylab.org/) specifically focuses on scaling real-time BCIs to decode whole body movements, and also on improving the accuracy of brain-to-speech models.

Outside of research, I like to do circuits/ML/woodworking [projects](/projects), take outdoor [photos](/photography), play with my dog, go on bike and trail running [adventures](https://www.strava.com/athletes/18147987), and race triathlon at the national level. I also help coach the UofM Triathlon [Club](https://www.instagram.com/umichtriathlon/).
